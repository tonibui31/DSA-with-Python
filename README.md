# Basic Sorting and Searching Exercise

## Exercise Overview

Build a program to perform sorting and searching tasks on a list of real numbers. The program consists of the following functions:

1. Input a list of real numbers of size n (n<=20) and save it to the file `INPUT.TXT`.
2. Read the data from the file `INPUT.TXT` and save it to a 1-dimensional array `a`, then display it on the screen.
3. Display the sorted elements of array `a` from step 2 in ascending order, using the Bubble Sort algorithm (display each step on a new line), and save it to the file `OUTPUT1.TXT`.
4. Display the sorted elements of array `a` from step 2 in ascending order, using the Selection Sort algorithm (display each step on a new line), and save it to the file `OUTPUT2.TXT`.
5. Display the sorted elements of array `a` from step 2 in ascending order, using the Insert Sort algorithm (display each step on a new line), and save it to the file `OUTPUT3.TXT`.
6. Using the sequential search method, list the indices of the elements (assuming the first element has an index of 0) in array `a` from step 2 that are greater than the value `value` (where `value` is a real number entered from the keyboard), and save the search results in the next line of the file `OUTPUT4.TXT`.
7. Using the binary search method, find the index of the first element in the sorted array `a` from step 2 that has the value `value` (where `value` is a real number entered from the keyboard).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and work with arrays.
- Learn how to read/write data to/from files.
- Understand and implement basic sorting algorithms.
- Understand and implement basic searching algorithms.

# Product Management

## Exercise Overview

Build a program to manage products in a supermarket warehouse, where each product has attributes such as Product ID, Product Name, Unit Price, and Quantity.

The program consists of the following functions:

1. Read existing data from a text file containing products and save them to a Linked List.
2. Input and add a new product to the end of the Linked List.
3. Display information of all products in the Linked List.
4. Save the list of products to a file.
5. Search for product information by ID.
6. Delete a product from the list by ID.
7. Sort the products in the list by ID.
8. Convert the quantity of the first element in the Linked List from base 10 to binary using recursive method.
9. Read data from a file containing products and save them to a stack. Then, retrieve each product from the stack and display it on the screen.
10. Read data from a file containing products and save them to a queue. Then, retrieve each product from the queue and display it on the screen.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of Linked List.
- Master working with Linked List operations.
- Learn how to read/write data to/from files.
- Understand and implement basic sorting algorithms on structured data.

# Employee Database

## Exercise Overview

Each profile requires the following information: Employee ID, Employee Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth. 
The employees will be distinguished by their unique Employee ID. 
The task requires using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to store and manage the data.

Build a program with the following functions:

1. Read data from a text file and populate a BST.
2. Add a new employee profile to the BST.
3. Traverse the BST in Inorder traversal.
4. Traverse the BST in Breadth-first traversal.
5. Search for employee information by Employee ID in the BST.
6. Remove an employee profile by Employee ID from the BST.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of a binary tree.
- Understand the concept of a binary search tree.
- Understand the concept of a queue.
- Familiarize with the operations on a queue.
